# UI-UX-Experiment6

## Aim:
1.      Solution Ideation

Use a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app).
Task:
Conduct crazy 8s or brainwriting ideation exercise.
Generate multiple low-fidelity ideas.
2.     Creating User Stories

Use personas and their goals to write user stories.
Task:
Write at least 5 user stories using this format:
As a [user], I want to [goal], so that [benefit].

3.     Creating Scenarios

Select a user story.
Task:
Create a narrative scenario that describes the user in context.
Include emotional states, tasks, and environment.
4.     Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping

 Choose a task (e.g., ordering food via app).
Task:
Draw a task flow diagram or user flow.
Use standard symbols (start, decision, action, etc.).
5.     Information Architecture (IA)

Take an example website or app (e.g., university site, news portal).
Task:
Perform card sorting (open or closed).
Create a site map showing categorized structure.

## **Solution Ideation**

Use a known UX problem (e.g., booking an appointment in a hospital app).

### ** Problem Statement**

Users often face difficulty navigating hospital apps to book appointments. Issues may include unclear navigation, too many steps, lack of doctor availability info, or non-intuitive UI.

---

### **Ideation Exercise: Crazy 8s (Adapted for Text)**

The **Crazy 8s method** involves sketching 8 different UI ideas or variations in 8 minutes. Since we can’t sketch here, we’ll write out **8 quick low-fidelity ideas** for solving the appointment booking UX problem.

---

### **1. One-Tap Appointment Button**

* A floating “Book Appointment” button on the home screen.
* Opens a bottom sheet with doctor categories, showing next available slots directly.

---

### **2. Smart Search Bar**

* Users can type symptoms like “fever” or “skin rash”.
* The app auto-suggests relevant departments and doctors with availability.

---

### **3. Calendar-First Flow**

* Starts with a calendar view.
* Users pick a date first, then see which doctors are available.

---

### **4. Doctor Card Carousel**

* Horizontal scrollable cards of doctors with filters (e.g., specialty, availability).
* Each card has "Book Now" and "Next Slot" options.

---

### **5. Chat-Based Booking Assistant**

* Conversational UI:
  "Hi, what’s the issue today?" → "When are you free?"
* AI guides through appointment booking via chat.

---

### **6. Department-Based Icons**

* Icons for departments (e.g.,  Cardiology,  Neurology).
* Clicking one shows available doctors sorted by rating and availability.

---

### **7. Recent Doctors Quick Access**

* A section for "Your Recent Doctors" on the homepage.
* Re-booking is one tap away, saving time for recurring visits.

---

### **8. Emergency vs Routine Flow**

* First step: “Emergency” vs “Routine”
* Emergency = shows closest available doctor instantly.
* Routine = shows filtered slots with calendar view.

---

**“As a \[user], I want to \[goal], so that \[benefit].”**

##  **Scenario: Aisha's Morning Rush**

### **User:** Aisha, 35 years old, mother of two (Rohan, 8 & Meera, 5)

### **Environment:** At home, early morning, juggling household chores

### **Device:** Android smartphone

### **Emotional State:** Stressed, time-pressed, slightly anxious

---

### **Narrative:**

It’s 7:30 AM on a Wednesday. Aisha is preparing breakfast while helping Rohan find his school socks and reminding Meera to finish her cereal. Suddenly, Meera starts coughing again — the same persistent cough from last week.

Aisha is worried but can’t afford to waste time. Her husband has already left for work, and she has 15 minutes before the school bus arrives.

She pulls out her smartphone and opens the hospital app. She navigates to her **"Family Profiles"**, quickly selects **Meera’s name**, and taps **"Book Appointment."**

She filters by **“Pediatrics”**, selects the **same doctor from last month**, and finds a 5:00 PM slot — just after school and her office hours.

She confirms the booking in under 90 seconds.

Feeling relieved, Aisha gets back to her morning chaos, comforted by the fact that Meera will see the doctor today.

---

### **Tasks Performed:**

* Identifies child needing care
* Opens app and accesses family profiles
* Selects child and relevant doctor
* Filters by availability
* Books an appointment

---

### **Emotional Journey:**

* Starts: **Stressed**, juggling responsibilities
* During: **Focused**, hoping for a quick solution
* After: **Relieved** and reassured
